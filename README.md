Still being set up and initialized. Some things to do:

\n 1.) Write all the latex needed to replicate the ODF files
\n 2.) Make the output PDFs look good
\n 3.) Make a few more latex files (one separating theorems from usedul_forms, one having series tests)
\n 4.) Remove ODF files from repo once latex mature enough
