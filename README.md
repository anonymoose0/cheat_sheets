Still being set up and initialized. Some things to do:

(DONE) Write all the latex needed to replicate the ODF files

2.) Make the output PDFs look good

3.) Make a few more latex files (one separating theorems from usedul_forms, one having series tests)

(DONE) Remove ODF files from repo once latex mature enough
