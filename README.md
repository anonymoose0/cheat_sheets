Still being set up and initialized. Some things to do:

1.) Write all the latex needed to replicate the ODF files
2.) Make the output PDFs look good
3.) Make a few more latex files (one separating theorems from usedul_forms, one having series tests)
4.) Remove ODF files from repo once latex mature enough
